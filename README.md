# Error Correcting Encoder Decoder

This project is built using a gradle.
Write down the text you want to transfer to the send.txt file
Run the program and type "encode" in the console to process the source text using Hamming code.
During the execution of the program, data will always be displayed in hexadecimal and binary.

To simulate a weak link transmission, type "send" in the console. During the program execution, an error will be made in each data byte. As a result, incorrect information will be displayed.

To decode the received data type "decode". As a result of the program execution, the received data will be processed using a special algorithm and the correct text will be displayed.
